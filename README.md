# DefiChain Liquidity Minining Balancer

## What is it for ? 

Currently this script will only Deposit your DFI into a given Vault. 
As I had to do this manually and I do not like it, this is what the script 

I works on a small footprint and it should be sufficient to run this 
on the smallest droplet (virtual machine) on DigitalOcean or on your Raspberry PI. 

## PreRequisites 

To be able to let this work, you will need you private key of your DeFiChain Light Wallet (mobile) 
Because it is not possible to extract it directly from the app, you will need to do the following 
steps (it does not work with SIIAVE Live - mobile version IOS !!) 

Download SIIAVE.live for your Desktop (tested it on OSX, but should work the same for Windows)
